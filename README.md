# QRS_detector
This project is associated to the deep learning course of my MSc program, and was developed by me and a colleague. 
The goal is to build a QRS detector based on ECG data. 
This repository comprises a notebook with preprocessing, model training and posprocessing and a report, for a better understanding of the whole work.

Due to space constraints the training and testing data as well as the models' parameters could not be added to the repository.
Nevertheless, the training data was extracted from Physionet's MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the testing data from Physionet's St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database
